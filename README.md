# Final Project


## Goal
My goal for this project is to create an rc car using an Arduino that will be able to go around a water bottle. 
This will be a task that will take time to complete. The materials I will need is Arduino, little car, wires, diagram, breadboard, solder, etc.

## Difficulties
* Finding a good car
* Combining the car and parts
* Wiring

## Risks
* Spending money for parts
* May take a lot of time to complete
* knowing and finding the right parts

## Steps
1. Get the parts
2. Draw wiring diagram
3. Breadboard wiring
4. Solder (using protoboard)
5. Combine the car with all parts to make the car be able to move
6. Make car go around water bottle

### Projected outcome
I believe this project will give me a lot of experience.
I believe this will lso be a good learning experience.
This project will be hard to complete but I think I can do it.
If I am not able to complete this project I think I will get stuck at the wiring portion.
